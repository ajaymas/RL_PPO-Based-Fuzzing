# Experimental Setup and Results

## 1. Environment Configuration

The experiments were conducted on a Kali Linux virtual machine with 8 GB RAM and four processors. The test binaries were executed within isolated containers to ensure security during fuzzing. AFL++, PyTorch, and necessary dependencies were installed to support both fuzzing and reinforcement learning processes

### System Specifications
(Table 1) Listing OS, CPU, RAM, installed software (AFL++, PyTorch, PPO settings).
### Table 1: Experimental Environment

| Component       | Details                |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| OS              | Kali Linux (VM)        |
| Processor       | 4-core CPU             |
| RAM             | 8GB                    |
| Fuzzing Tool    | AFL++ (QEMU mode)      |
| RL Framework    | PyTorch                |
| Target Binaries | OpenSSL 1.1.1f, Uroboros SPEC CPU2006 |


#### 2) Dataset Preparation
For evaluation, we utilized:
- **OpenSSL 1.1.1f**: A widely used cryptographic library known for security-critical functions.
- **Uroboros SPEC CPU2006 Binaries**: Stripped binaries used for assessing disassembly and decompilation tools.

The combination of these binaries provided a diverse set of test cases, ensuring a robust evaluation of the fuzzing framework.

### B. Implementation Details

#### 3) AFL++ Configuration
AFL++ was configured with its default mutation strategies in QEMU mode to enable binary-only fuzzing without requiring source code instrumentation. Persistent mode and deferred forkserver optimizations were enabled to improve performance. Custom mutation strategies were also integrated to allow PPO to dynamically modify input patterns based on feedback from the Feedback Analyzer.

#### 4) PPO Model Integration
The PPO model, implemented using PyTorch, received feedback from the execution engine, including coverage metrics and crash reports. Key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and policy network architecture were fine-tuned through iterative testing to ensure optimal performance.

## 3. Performance Evaluation


### C. Evaluation Metrics
To assess the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzing framework, we measured the following metrics:

- Code Coverage (%) – Explored paths in binaries.
   - **Code Coverage (%)**: The percentage of executable code paths explored during fuzzing.

- Crash Discovery Rate (Crashes/sec) – Identifying vulnerabilities.
   - **Crash Discovery Rate**: The number of unique crashes identified within a given timeframe.

- Execution Speed (Test cases/sec) – Processing efficiency.
- **Execution Speed (Test Cases per Second)**: The performance efficiency in generating and executing test cases.
